Railway Reservation System
==========================

This is a Python application for managing railway reservations. The app is built using the Tkinter GUI library and SQLite database. This system lets you run various RUD(Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on the system's data which includes train details, passenger details, booked tickets and their details.

The process for installing Python and Tkinter depends on your operating system. Here are the general steps for Windows, Mac, and Linux:
Windows:
1.	Go to the Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows. Choose the appropriate one depending on your operating system from the downloads.
2.	Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python.
3.	Once Python is installed, open a command prompt and type "pip install tkinter" to install the Tkinter package.
SQLite3
1.	Go to the SQLite download page (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and download the precompiled binaries for Windows.
2.	Extract the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.
3.	Add the path to the extracted folder to your system's PATH environment variable.
After installing SQLite3, you can use it in your Python programs by importing the sqlite3 module


Navigate to the root of the project directory and run the `rrs.ipynb` file to start the app.
